This is a blog about programming, HPC, science and more.

It contains summaries of interesting books and papers as well as links to news
I might find interesting. Moreover, I write about my work from time to time.


## About me

I am working in the HPC Applications division at the
[Max Planck Computing and Data Facility](https://mpcdf.mpg.de) in Garching near
Munich, the central computing center of the Max Planck Society.
I mainly develop and optimize HPC codes (one big project is the
[octopus code](https://octopus-code.org)), but I also do benchmarking, software
maintenance and related stuff.

Before, I worked on simulations of hydrodynamic processes in stars, specifically
stellar mergers and explosions. I also did my PhD in this field at the
University of Heidelberg and the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies.
